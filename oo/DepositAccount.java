/**
 * TODO: Deposit Account is a type of Bank Account
 * The only different is that you cannot withdraw from this account
 * If you do have a withdraw method, you should throw an exception
 * You can deposit and set interest rate but you can only
 * close the account (which will withdraw all the money and any interest)
 * Would you use inheritance? if yes, which class would you use
 * BankAccount or BankAccountWithInterest?
 * Do you see the use of any interface now that you have created a few
 * Bank account classes?
